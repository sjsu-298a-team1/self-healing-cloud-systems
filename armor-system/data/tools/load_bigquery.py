"""Load the Parquet lakehouse into BigQuery and verify it arrived intact.

`build_warehouse.py` writes the tables; this moves them into a warehouse that
can actually be queried, which is the last hop the data-pipeline demo asks for:
ingestion from source through to a warehouse, with the file layout, tables and
schemas shown, and the data verified as stored correctly.

Verification is the point of the second half. A load job that reports success
has told you it parsed the files, not that the warehouse now holds what the
lakehouse holds. So after loading, every table's row count is read back from
BigQuery and compared with `_manifest.json`, and `fact_telemetry` is also
checked by partition, by split and by a checksum over its values. A mismatch
exits non-zero.

Authentication is Application Default Credentials, so no key file exists and
nothing secret is read by this script:

    gcloud auth application-default login
    gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project <project>

Then:

    python -I load_bigquery.py --project armor-d1 [--dataset armor_d1] [--replace]

The BigQuery sandbox is free and needs no billing account. It does apply a
60-day expiry to every table, which is recorded in the load report rather than
left to surprise someone in January.
